Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment
====================================

The following files are in this repo:  
1. README.md - describe the repo and the replication steps  
2. README.html - the generated HTML file from the README.md file  
3. run_analysis.R - the R code that transform the raw data to tidy data  
4. CodeBook.md - the code book decribes the transformation, the variables and the data  
5. CodeBook,html - the generated HTML file from the CodeBook.md file  
6. tidyData.txt - the transformed tidy dataset  

To replicate, download the raw data and execute the R code.  The output will be the tidyData.txt file.  You may need to modify the setwd() and/or rename the file in write.table().
